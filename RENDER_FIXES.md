# Render Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. WebRTC Connection Errors
**Error**: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'sendto'`

**Fix**: Updated STUN server configuration with multiple fallback servers in [src/core/webrtc_processor.py](src/core/webrtc_processor.py:20-32)

### 2. Browser Camera JS Module Loading Error
**Error**: `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module`

**Fix**: Updated Streamlit configuration in [.streamlit/config.toml](.streamlit/config.toml) to disable XSRF protection and enable proper CORS handling

---

## What To Do Now:

### Push Changes to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix WebRTC and browser camera issues for Render deployment"
git push
```

### Render Will Auto-Deploy:
- Render watches your `main` branch
- It will automatically redeploy when you push
- Watch the logs in Render dashboard

## If WebRTC Still Has Issues:

WebRTC can be tricky on cloud platforms. If it still doesn't work perfectly, **use Browser Camera Snapshot mode instead**:

1. Users select "ðŸ“¸ Browser Camera Snapshot" mode
2. Click "Take Photo" to capture signs
3. Works 100% reliably on all platforms
4. Still gets real-time detection, just not continuous video

---

## Alternative: Use Streamlit Community Cloud

If WebRTC continues to be problematic on Render, consider deploying to **Streamlit Community Cloud** instead:

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Deploy - it's optimized for Streamlit apps
4. WebRTC works better there

## Performance Notes:

- First load after sleep: ~30 seconds (free tier)
- Model inference on CPU: ~100-200ms per frame (acceptable)
- To speed up, upgrade to paid tier with more CPU cores

---

## Testing Checklist:

After redeployment, test:
- [ ] WebRTC Live mode - click START, allow camera
- [ ] Browser Camera Snapshot mode - take photos
- [ ] AI interpretation (if API key provided)
- [ ] Buffer working (2-second intervals)
- [ ] Interpretation history showing

Good luck! ðŸš€
